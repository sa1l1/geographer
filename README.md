# GeoGrapher

GeoGrapher is an online graphing software for CS problems created by USACO participants.

## How to use

Simply enter the top left/right or bottom left/right coordinates for your geometric figure. The website just connects the dots you provide and if you provide which shape you're using it will find the remaining points optimally.
